# New-Rocket-Pool-Decentralised-Ethereum-Liquid-Staking-Protocol
New Liquid Staking Protocol.

Why It’s Different
Lower capital requirement, 8 ETH instead of 32 ETH
Better yield than solo staking for node operators
Decentralized alternative to centralized exchanges’ staking services
Permissionless: anyone can run a node, no approval required

For Node Operators
People who want to run validator nodes can join Rocket Pool by staking 8 ETH (instead of the full 32 ETH)
Rocket Pool pairs that 8 ETH with the ETH deposited by rETH users to make a full validator
They earn consensus rewards (ETH) plus commission from the rETH users for running the node

For Regular Stakers
Users can stake as little as 0.01 ETH by depositing into Rocket Pool’s smart contracts
In return, they receive rETH (Rocket Pool ETH), a liquid staking token that automatically accrues staking rewards over time
rETH can be traded, used in DeFi, or redeemed for ETH + rewards
